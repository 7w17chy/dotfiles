Remember to start mdp as user, not system-wide!
It's easier to configure and has less overhead!

If you do so, remember to also start it as a user:
    systemctl --user enable mpd
    systemctl --user start mpd
So that it will use the user-specific config file.

Sometimes mpd is already started or run as system service.
If so, kill it with fire!
    sudo systemctl stop mpd.socket
    sudo systemctl stop mpd
    sudo systemctl disable mpd.socket
    sudo systemctl disable mpd
    sudo killall mpd
mpd.socket is a service that is able to restart mpd all the time, btw.
